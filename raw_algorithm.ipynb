    "The `select_population` function performs **selection** in the artificial immune system (AIS) algorithm. It combines the current population and the new population (generated through mutation or other operations), evaluates their fitness, and selects the best solutions to form the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Parameters**\n",
    "- `population`: The current population of solutions.\n",
    "- `new_population`: The new population of solutions generated through mutation or other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Returns**\n",
    "- A new population containing the best solutions from the combined population.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Combine populations**\n",
    "- The current population and the new population are combined into a single list called `combined_population`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Evaluate solutions**\n",
    "- The fitness of each solution in the combined population is evaluated using the `evaluate_solution` function. This function calculates the total cost of a solution, which includes:\n",
    "  - **Preference Cost**: The cost of consolation gifts for families based on their assigned days.\n",
    "  - **Accounting Penalty**: Additional costs due to daily occupancy fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Sort solutions**\n",
    "- The combined population is sorted by their fitness scores in ascending order (lower cost is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Select best solutions**\n",
    "- The top `len(population)` solutions are selected to form the next generation. This ensures that the population size remains constant."
