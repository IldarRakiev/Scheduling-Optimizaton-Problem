    "\n",
    "### **Description**\n",
    "The `select_population` function performs **selection** in the artificial immune system (AIS) algorithm. It combines the current population and the new population (generated through mutation or other operations), evaluates their fitness, and selects the best solutions to form the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Parameters**\n",
    "- `population`: The current population of solutions.\n",
    "- `new_population`: The new population of solutions generated through mutation or other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Returns**\n",
    "- A new population containing the best solutions from the combined population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Combine populations**\n",
    "- The current population and the new population are combined into a single list called `combined_population`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Evaluate solutions**\n",
    "- The fitness of each solution in the combined population is evaluated using the `evaluate_solution` function. This function calculates the total cost of a solution, which includes:\n",
    "  - **Preference Cost**: The cost of consolation gifts for families based on their assigned days.\n",
    "  - **Accounting Penalty**: Additional costs due to daily occupancy fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Sort solutions**\n",
    "- The combined population is sorted by their fitness scores in ascending order (lower cost is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Select best solutions**\n",
    "- The top `len(population)` solutions are selected to form the next generation. This ensures that the population size remains constant."

    "## Simulated Annealing\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is used to find a global optimum in a large search space by exploring both good and bad solutions, with the probability of accepting worse solutions decreasing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Add SA to AIS?**\n",
    "- **AIS Limitation**: The Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm is good at exploring the search space but may get stuck in local optima.\n",
    "- **SA Strength**: SA can escape local optima by accepting worse solutions with a decreasing probability, allowing it to explore more of the search space.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Benefit**: By combining AIS with SA, we leverage the exploration capabilities of AIS and the exploitation capabilities of SA, leading to better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How SA Works**\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial solution and set an initial temperature.\n",
    "2. **Neighbor Generation**: Generate a neighboring solution by making small changes (e.g., mutation).\n",
    "3. **Acceptance Criteria**:\n",
    "   - If the neighbor solution is better, accept it.\n",
    "   - If the neighbor solution is worse, accept it with a probability based on the temperature and the cost difference.\n",
    "4. **Cooling Schedule**: Gradually reduce the temperature to decrease the probability of accepting worse solutions.\n",
    "5. **Termination**: Stop after a fixed number of iterations or when the temperature reaches a minimum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Parameters**\n",
    "- **Initial Temperature**: Controls the initial probability of accepting worse solutions.\n",
    "- **Cooling Rate**: Determines how quickly the temperature decreases.\n",
    "- **Maximum Iterations**: The number of iterations SA runs to refine the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Integration with AIS**\n",
    "- After each iteration of AIS, the best solution is refined using SA.\n",
    "- This hybrid approach ensures that the best solutions found by AIS are further improved, leading to lower total costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Outcome**\n",
    "- The hybrid AIS-SA algorithm should produce **better solutions** (lower total cost) compared to using AIS alone.\n",
    "- The algorithm will be more **robust** and less likely to get stuck in local optima."
